# Logic Design Final Project: Laser Breakout

# Addendum:
Using the VGA adapter on the Altera DE2-115 is really hard.  
I'd like to thank Professor Brockman for figuring out how to use the DE2's VGA adapter so that us mere mortals weren't struggling for eternity. Seriously though, my partner and I were stuck working with the VGA for hours, only for Dr. Brockman to fix our problems in a matter of minutes. He is a true genius.  
This project uses a High Level State Machine to move the laser across the screen. It acts as a collision detector and plays sound, too.  
For more information on the project, and to see the Altera board in action (since you probably don't have one), I've linked some resources to help:
